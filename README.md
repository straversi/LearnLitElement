Syntax highlighting not working? Try throwing

```javascript
css`a { color: blue; }`;
```

or 

<!-- This file is generated, so keep this commented or else cause an error. -->
<!-- ```js-templates
css`a { color: blue; }`;
``` -->

into a file and regenerate until it does. wtf.

Theory: js-templates is not a language, which
causes an error. Is this triggering something?
